## Research algorithms

This is the code in my life.

The reason of why I start learning algorithms

* I realized the importance of the algorithm when I implemented the distributed database engine.
* I hope the code that I write could be high effective.
* because I don't often use algorithms make me almost forgot how to use algorithms.

At last, I wish I have mastered the general algorithm as soon as possible and exerted value in practical work !!!
